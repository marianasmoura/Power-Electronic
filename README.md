 The characteristic curves of the Duty Cycle D were developed according to the load current ratio (Io / Io.max) of the Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost converters.
 The .m files show separately the curvas for each converter. The .mlx file show all converters with explanation of the procedure for plotting the characteristic curves.
